    <p>
      From a very early age, I've been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take apart anything so I could see how it worked—and then try to put it back together. As you can imagine, it drove my parents nuts. But even though I tortured my family at times, the tinkering trait has served me well in my career. After graduating from Purdue, I was recruited into a field technician job and got paid to take apart broken packaging equipment. It was like living the dream. That job also made me realize I'm really good with difficult customers, and that's what helped me land my current account manager role. While I love my job and have been successful in it, it has moved me away from the manufacturing floor. Now, the reason I'm so interested in this position is that it seems to provide a really great blend of one-on-one work with clients and hands-on problem solving.

      In my current role as the marketing analyst responsible for a shampoo product line, my core responsibility is to assist the marketing manager to prepare the analytics for monthly sales, as well as a sales prediction model. I also manage the campaign budget, prepare wrap-up reports, and connect with our marketing agencies. All of this requires analytical thinking, attention to detail, and clear communication skills. My current role has provided me solid execution experience in all the marketing aspects, including campaign planning, campaign management and analysis. I am looking for a marketing manager role, where I can make a bigger impact as an individual contributor, as well as delve into strategic planning, and potentially grow into a people manager in a few years.

    <p>
      I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life, personal and professional. In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most. I’ve taken on many different types of projects, including ads, virtual reality, commerce, and messaging. No matter what I’m working on, I’m very invested. I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process. In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles. I found it fascinating, and it actually sparked a desire to change industries — which eventually led me to my last role and even helped prepare me for the switch. Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.

### **Answer framework**

This is something you'll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that'll help you nail the opener.

**Be succinct, honest and engaging.**

I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.

**Use the job description to prepare.**

Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.

**Tie your story to their needs.**

People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.

### Tips

- Prepare for this question in advance and have a compelling story about your past experiences.
- Pull prominent skills from the job description.
- Be “SHE” (succinct, honest and engaging).

## **What is your greatest strength?**

### Overview

Employers want to see if you can strike the right balance between confidence and humility. Hiring managers also want to get a sense for how self-aware and honest you are and align your strengths to the role at hand.

- **Sample answer 1:**
  What I bring to the team is a strong record in relationship building. I'm happiest when I'm engaging and strategizing about how we can help one another. I find that in sales, some people can be overly transactional. I think my superpower is in establishing more meaningful connections. I've gotten strong feedback in the past. One client said I was the best business development person he'd ever met. These types of connections have turned into big sales wins. For example, last year, I doubled my client base and outperformed my peers by 40%. And it's probably relevant to share that I started in that role without any contacts in the field. Today, there isn't a Fortune 100 company that doesn't know about the product I sold last. Why this answer worked well:She was specific and shared real numbers.She stayed relevant. The experience and the story all came together and she supported it all with numbers.
- **Sample answer 2:**
  My greatest strength is strategic thinking. I am often able to quickly spot patterns and issues and create alternatives before my teammates even realize there is an issue. The way this shows up in my work experience is through risk mitigation. As an example, I was starting a new project with a new team in an industry I had never worked in before. The team seemed to think that the project was very straight-forward and that they didn’t even really need a project manager to help them. We kicked off the project by creating a charter, social contract, and reviewing the risks. We got halfway through the project and realized the requirements were ambiguous and we weren’t delivering what the client really wanted. I had picked up on some subtle cues that this was the case and had already taken the initiative to meet with the client to clarify the requirements. I presented my findings to the team and showed three alternatives to our existing plan to accommodate the updated requirements. From my team’s point of view, I was able to bring solutions to the problem conversation and we didn’t lose any time with the project timeline. It was a win win! Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to detect issues and opportunities early.The example showed a willingness to take initiative to improve clarity and process.
- **Sample answer 3:**
  Over the last several years, I’ve realized my strength as an analytical thinker who is extremely thorough and organized. In my current role, I run multiple 360 marketing campaigns and ads across social touchpoints — all at the same time. So it’s really important to consolidate all the campaign results together and across different channels to see which platform actually generates the highest ROI. I’ve been able to boost the success of past projects by looking at results per week and month to build cumulative results and identify where incremental results lie. This type of modeling requires analytical accuity to read the numbers quickly and make strong, informed marketing investments. One big project I have been working on for a year is about understanding the marketing budget efficiency. Running ads simultaneously on social media has made it hard to attribute the growth to these channels. I work closely with the sales reps from these companies, and also third-party vendors to understand how these platforms attribute the conversions. With all the data points consolidated, I was able to calculate the real ROI of these platforms, and thus saved the company 25% cost in marketing spend. Why this answer worked well:The candidate provided very clear examples to illustrate why analytical thinking and organizational skill are strengths.The answer included enough details (such as metrics evaluation and optimization) to demonstrate expertise.The candidate showed how their strengths had directly benefited their employer
- **Sample answer 4:**
  My greatest strength is that I am equally at ease when talking to executives, business users, and engineers. I come from an engineering background, but I have a very strong understanding of the business. This well-rounded view allows me to connect with colleagues from disparate departments and points of view quickly and authentically. I also have the ability to see the big, strategic picture, while not losing sight of the nuts and bolts. I can create and execute a strategy at a high level while also understanding the execution difficulties at an engineering level. Over the course of my career, I have found that many leaders generally do one or the other, and my ability to do both has proven to be advantageous to my projects and teams. By understanding the challenges from multiple angles, I’m able to connect dots and create solutions. This is evidenced by my track record of building and managing high performance teams. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to understand the big pictures beyond his immediate area of expertise.The answer highlighted the candidate’s ability to contribute both at higher strategy level and at executive level.

### **Answer framework**

When responding to this question, you want to sound humble and not like you’re arrogant or bragging. Here are some tips to help you give them a great answer.

**Describe a relevant experience.**

If you're applying for a sales job, tell a story about a time where you helped a customer solve a problem with your solution.

**Give specific details.**

Tell them about a time you closed a deal that helped you hit a percentage of your annual number. When you share those facts with them, it helps them visualise how effective you have been.

**Show them you’re a well-rounded person.**

For example, share a story of when you used a “soft” skill, like effective communication with a coworker, and then one about you using a technical skill, which could be anything asked for in the job description.

### Tips

- Be authentic - don’t make up strengths that you think the employer wants to hear.
- Tell a story about a work experience.
- Be sure the strengths you share are aligned to the role you want.

## **What is your greatest weakness?**

### Overview

The interviewer is assessing whether your weaknesses will get in the way of doing the job. Employers are looking for humility and whether you’re committed to learning and growing. This is a place you can showcase what you’re doing to improve.

- **Sample answer 1:**
  I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines. I've been reflecting on why this happens. As I've become more conscious of this pattern, I'm working on ways to contain the negative aspects of my eagerness. One way that I do this is to still go to brainstorming meetings but to be more careful about offering to do the next steps—or limit it to one project that my boss supports. Fortunately, though, the job we're discussing seems well-suited for people like me, people that bring a lot of enthusiasm to the job and are ready to keep getting better and better at the follow-through. Why this answer worked well:He shared a story about how a weakness would negatively impact his work and stress him out.He turned his self-awareness into a plan to help him manage that weakness so he would be successful in the future.He shared specific details, which made the story feel relatable.
- **Sample answer 2:**
  In my current role as a product manager, I’m responsible for specific feature building. So, I work with a lot of cross-functional teams like engineers and designers. I think one thing that I can always improve on is patience, taking time to really see and understand other people’s perspectives — especially considering we are always rushing to meet tight deadlines. I always want things to move quickly and precisely, which I’ve realized can make my partners a bit anxious. To help with this, I’m working to help build trust. I’ve been scheduling more frequent check-ins with the teams to make sure that everyone is comfortable with the project timeline. And I’ve made myself more open so that they can share any missed opportunities that they see as we go. This gives us a chance to get out ahead of things and make sure we’re all totally aligned even as we work fast. Why this answer worked well:The answer was honest and demonstrated an understanding of how this weakness can affect team members.A clear improvement strategy was outlined.
- **Sample answer 3:**
  I have a strong desire to succeed, which generally serves me well. But I’ve realized that it can also be a blind spot if I’m not being honest with myself about what’s possible. A few years ago, I was working on a remote control, and the schedule was very tight. We were trying to go from concept to mass production in six months, and there was a high amount of pressure. I made the decision to continue with the factory build, even though my team was concerned that one of the parts we were using would fail. Because we had already spent $200,000 on the factory process, I pushed ahead. I was afraid to tell the program managers that we wouldn’t be able to hit our targets. Eventually, I was forced to — but I had already lost the company money. What I learned from this is the importance of being honest right up front and being realistic, even if it’s not the outcome I want. I’ve learned that failures can be turned around more easily when addressed quickly. Now I communicate status with program managers on a weekly basis. I always make them aware of the risks and what the impact might be. In the past four years, we haven't missed a single delivery. Why this answer worked well:The answer provided an honest self-review with a clear example that took the interviewer through the decision-making process.The candidate took accountability and specific steps to prevent another issue.
- **Sample answer 4:**
  I have worked on my inclination to hold back on giving tough feedback. A few roles ago, I’d just been promoted to management and joined a project that my boss was leading. The work was about 30% baked when I joined, and I knew right away that it wasn’t strong. I spoke up, but not strongly enough. The agency was pushing their work hard, and I decided not to rock the boat. Unfortunately, as the project progressed, I noticed more and more issues. And as I feared, the campaign bombed. Even though I hadn’t kicked off the project, I was a part of the team, and I owned a big piece of the failure for not sticking to my guns. I learned on that day that even if people don’t agree with you — even if the boss doesn’t agree with you — you owe it to the team and company to vocalize concerns. I’ve taken that lesson a step further by creating the kind of space on my teams for people to dissent, to push back, and to disagree. I firmly believe that successful teams are built on a foundation of respectful, honest communication. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed a willingness to accept responsibility for failure.A clear pivot showed how this weakness was turned into an improvement for teams.

This can feel like a tricky question, but it’s a good opportunity to shine. Here are some tips on how to answer:

**Be humble.**

You want to communicate an authentic story that shows you're self-aware. It's okay that you don't come off as perfect, that's authentic, which is important for someone who will have to trust you in the role that they're hiring for.

**Choose a trait that is not too relevant to the job.**

For example, if you're applying for a project manager role, choose a weakness that is more related to creativity, which is something that doesn't disqualify you from the description of the things that would make someone successful in that role

**Show how you manage it.**

Have a fix-it strategy. For example, if you struggle with remembering product details so you track them in their phone or side notebook, that's okay, share that with them. That shows that you've got commitment to solving that problem and addressing it.

### Tips

- Employers are looking for self-awareness and personal accountability.
- It’s good to be honest about what you’re not great at.
- Share what you are doing to actively improve on this weakness.

## **Why should we hire you?**

### Overview

This question tests how persuasive you are. Interviewers want to see if you can make a calm, confident case for yourself, even if they’re acting skeptical. They’re looking for factual and compelling answers.

- **Sample answer 1:**
  I've got both the experience and target audience rapport that you're looking for. I've built two corporate training programs from scratch and developed the kind of interactive video programs that you're looking to create. When employees fill out feedback forms, they speak highly of my professionalism and clarity that they've encountered. Here’s a quick example. A close friend of mine on your marketing team says that this company is a great cultural fit given my background and values. I have an insatiable level of curiosity and tend to do lots of research on any topic that I'm less than an expert in. And I know your values include constant learning. That really resonates with my passion. I'm just eager to become part of a fast-growing, mission-oriented organization like yours. Why this answer worked well:He spoke about his core strengths in a way that related to the job requirements.He used favorable feedback from some of his previous coworkers, and their positive observations were helpful.He talked about why he was a good cultural fit for the organization.
- **Sample answer 2:**
  Having worked in strategy and sales roles across different geographies, I believe I am uniquely positioned to add a lot of value to this general managerial position. What separates me from most is my ability to take a holistic view of the business, set the vision, and translate that into a set of strong strategic solutions. Given my experience across different functions, I also have the ability to connect and influence cross-functional partners to drive business results, which I believe will be critical in this position. My background studying engineering and business taught me to balance the logic and data with the human side of things, which will be a competitive advantage in this ambiguous and dynamic industry. I’m motivated and excited to learn your company’s unique business model, and from my interactions with the employees here, I can see that we share values like respect, trust, and excellence. Overall, I believe I bring the right mix of skills, experiences and attitude for the job and think that my varied experience can add a lot of value here. Why this answer worked well:The answer incorporated specific qualifications that set the candidate apart.Strengths were framed through the lens of how they could benefit the company.
- **Sample answer 3:**
  As a data scientist, I’ve demonstrated my ability to answer business questions, as well as advise strategic marketing decisions by providing in-depth data analysis with various technical skills, such as SQL and R. Part of my role has been to evaluate a $30M marketing budget and make recommendations. A recent marketing strategy that I proposed eventually drove growth of 10% for the business. I am also proactive in learning new skills. For example, knowing that effective communication is the key to making findings convincing, I sought out and took training sessions on both data visualization and presentation. These skill sets have been critical in successfully pitching and persuading senior leadership on changes to strategy. As a result, I was quickly promoted to a senior role in just a year. Given the growth moment that your company is poised to have, I believe that my unique experience will be an asset to your team. I’m excited to expand my expertise within a new industry, and recommend key strategies and opportunities that will support and drive business. Why this answer worked well:The answer featured a blend of quantifiable results and personal strengths.There was clear awareness of the company’s trajectory and enthusiasm for the role.
- **Sample answer 4:**
  My resume demonstrates that I’ve been successful with the key responsibilities of this role: managing teams, developing strategic sales plans, and delivering quarterly targets. I’ve been managing teams for the last 10 years and to this day, many of my former direct reports still call and ask for career or personal advice. I’ve also led the development of strategic plans with the customer for years. I first listen and understand their priorities and objectives, then develop a win-win solution for both parties. Last year my team received 2 awards. The first was from our internal organization for collaboration and partnership in developing our 3-year plans. The second was the Vendor of The Year Award from the customer for putting together plans that exceeded their growth targets. I’ve been in sales for the last 15 years and I know how important it is to hit targets — it’s the lifeblood of what we do. That’s why I work hard to support and guide my team, as well as work with internal partners to anticipate and remove roadblocks. I believe I would be a great fit for this role as I already have relevant experience and been successful in my previous roles. Why this answer worked well:The answer detailed deep industry knowledge and a record of success across several themes.The focus on teams painted a picture of an invested leader who sees success as collective.

### **Answer framework**

his is a nerve-racking question, so make sure you're set up for success. Here are some tips that can help you do well in answering it:

Prepare for the interview by picking three or four qualifications and experiences that help them understand why you're a fit for this job.

**Tell them how you’d fit in.**

### Tips

- Start with the three or four best reasons you’ve got.
- Cite results, credentials, and other people’s praise so you don’t seem self-absorbed.
- Be concise, and invite follow-up questions at the end.

## **Why do you want to work here?**

### Overview

Interviewers want to understand what prompted you to apply for this job. They don’t want candidates who are indifferent to where they work. Instead, they want someone who offers very specific reasons for why they want this job.

- **Sample answer 1:**
  The first thing that prompted me to apply is your commitment to service. I've been a customer for five years since I first bought a house. We had a big storm that damaged my roof last year, and I was impressed by how caring and prompt your customer service representatives were as I worked through it. I'm also excited about your upcoming merger. I can see how this is going to set you apart in the insurance industry. I'd love to help you through the process of integrating the two companies. Having supported a merger three years ago, I know what an intricate and stressful process that can be. I have a few specific ideas on how I might ease the transition. Lastly, I applied because I see this as an opportunity for me to broaden my financial services experience. This seems to be a natural fit based on my understanding of regulated industries. Why this answer worked well:He has done his homework and sees an opportunity to help this company through a challenging and exciting transition.He made it about them first and then wove in some of his own personal career goals.
- **Sample answer 2:**
  I grew up in a household that only used your products. Even when we faced tremendous financial difficulty, my mother would always buy razors manufactured by your company – that’s when you realize the role you play in the lives of your consumer is much more than cleaning. You make life a little bit easier, allowing people the time, space and energy to live life at its fullest. When my father immigrated to the U.S from India, I was 6 years old. I don’t remember much – all I remember is that my dad packed 2 suitcases, a box of his mother’s favorite sweets and your company’s personal care products. That’s how important the product is to him and it’s the only razor he has ever used and it’s the only razor I have ever used. I want to work for a brand like that – and I want to bring my father to this office and see the factory where his product is made, first-hand. Why this answer worked well:The answer showed that the candidate is deeply invested in the brand, creating an emotional connection to the company's vision.The personal story showed a real connection to the brand, and genuine enthusiasm for the job.

### Overview

Employers want to understand your capacity to step up and handle tough situations that undoubtedly arise in the workplace. They want to know when you’ve seen an opening to lean in and lead with good judgment.

- **Sample answer 1:**
  Recently there was a situation where my manager needed to take medical leave and was unable to come into work for a few weeks. This coincided with a major deadline that he was leading. I knew that if this project wasn't completed on time, we were at risk of losing a major client. I looked to my right and my left, and there wasn't anyone else who could own the project, so I jumped in with both feet and took the initiative. I went through the files and developed a schedule detailing what needed to be completed, and I worked with my coworkers to ensure they were on board too. In the end, we were able to complete the project by the deadline. The client was pleased and stayed on as a loyal customer to the company. When my boss came back, he gave me an end-of-quarter bonus because he was impressed I was able to rally everyone to complete the project. Why this answer worked well:She shared details that make it easy to visualize what was happening.She described how she got her coworkers onboard and met the deadline to keep her loyal client.

  I was working on a high visibility project and during production, two members on my cross-functional team had different approaches to a problem that we were facing. They both wanted credit for being right, and we were at a stalemate. To move forward, I needed to help align the team. I wasn’t their reporting manager but I was the project lead, so I asked them to explain the pros and cons of their approach. I encouraged them to fairly assess their solutions and moderated the discussion so that it stayed productive and respectful. As they laid out their plans, it became clear that a hybrid approach would be best for the company. I encouraged them to see this as a team win towards a common goal that would reflect positively on everyone. Using the hybrid approach, we not only delivered a superior solution, but completed the project 2 weeks ahead of schedule because the team was so motivated. Why this answer worked well:The answer highlighted both communication and moderation skills.Beyond the success of achieving consensus, the candidate improved the project timeline.
- **Sample answer 3:**
  During a recent project, I was responsible for helping to improve the margins of an existing product line used by multiple customer segments. The product had multiple elements of design, manufacturing, and software support. Leadership had been eyeing cost-cutting efforts for some time. My first step was to clearly understand the situation and how the product had become less profitable. So, I sat down with the design, sales, marketing, and operations teams to document all perspectives. In parallel, I met with the finance team to clearly understand areas of potential savings. In the end, I identified 3 clear steps: streamline processes around assembly and testing, make small design tweaks to remove unnecessary features, and simplify the product overall. Making this proposal required talking to each team individually, armed with financial data that could convince them that this effort was worthwhile. The data had to make sense and projections needed to be realistic. I also needed to leverage my technical background to understand nuances in the design and assembly. Ultimately, the effort saved the company more than $5M over the next two years, and helped set the precedent for efficient and lean product development. Why this answer worked well:The answer set the stage and detailed each action step.The candidate’s approach showed a holistic view of the challenge and deep understanding of the business.Leadership skills were proven by significant, quantifiable results.
- **Sample answer 4:**
  A few years ago, I took over the Web Operations team of a major company. This was a new area for me and when I stepped into the role, I immediately identified a clear need to completely rebuild 35 worldwide websites across eight different languages. I created a plan for the rebuild which included hiring additional technical writers, securing media agencies, acquiring new software, and more. This plan was meant to be enacted over 18 months but after I presented my plan to executive management, the CEO requested that we complete the project before the end of the year. This gave us just 12 months, which meant we had to rethink our project plan. The readjustment required the addition of even more resources and distributing the translation work to different teams — all while managing risk carefully. I am happy to say that after 12 months, the project was completed successfully, and team morale remained high throughout the process. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated their ability to identify opportunity areas.The solution required a blend of soft and technical skills and the ability to lead cross-functional teams.The example also highlighted the ability to adjust a plan to meet aggressive deadlines.

### Overview

If you can show that you’ve helped a team move through a challenge, you probably have strong communication and interpersonal skills. These kinds of “soft” skills are in high demand and make people successful in their jobs.

- **Sample answer 1:**
  I was asked to work on a high-profile project that included collaborating with a new team and tons of people across a larger organization. We were spread out across the globe, which meant timezones were tricky and we could never meet face-to-face. Communication was starting to get confusing, and people were losing important details. It became apparent that this project was going to fail if we didn’t have a new strategy, so I met with various team members and engaged them in a process where we designed and implemented a communication system that would work a lot better. We then did weekly check-ins; designed a protocol to share relevant updates so we’d stay on track; developed a detailed outline of goals and milestones; and led the meetings. In the end, the team made massive progress. We completed the project on time, and it was praised extensively by the client. The team thanked me for helping to course-correct. We also continue to use these tools, and they are what make our team so much more efficient at what we do. Why this answer worked well:She started off discussing a specific situation and the issues involved with having to work on a global team.She talked about the specific action steps she took like implementing a new work process.She described the positive results and teamwork skills she demonstrated along the way.
- **Sample answer 2**
  While working for a major airline, I was on a team that was tasked to jointly determine the growth plans for a joint venture we operated in partnership with two other airlines. Naturally, the team was made up of individuals based around the world, each with very different views on the economic and competitive landscape. At first, our plans clashed significantly. One challenge we were trying to solve in our term sheet was how to adjust our plans during times of economic uncertainty. Each team had a different idea for what actions to take, and when. To help reach alignment I proposed that we look at real historic examples of economic downturns, bankruptcies, volcanic eruptions, and similar events — and use them as case examples to set a range of appropriate reactions. Then, we’d tie these reactions to indicators, such as global passenger volume, GDP growth, and stock market indicators — all universally understood and applicable. Once we established this framework for using hard data to guide acceptable strategic actions, the team was able to collaborate with more trust and a common language. Our analysis was unified and based on the same inputs, and this allowed us to quickly and successfully align on a term sheet for the joint venture. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showcased their ability to align stakeholders with very divergent points of view.The answer included strategic thinking skills and personal initiative.
- **Sample answer 3**
  I joined a team 6 months after the MVP launch which was moderately successful, but short of management expectations. Without a real roadmap, the team was just running small experiments to drive incremental gains. I quickly realized that we’d need to do more than that to realize the long-term vision of the product. To gain the trust of my new team, I focused on what could be improved in the immediate future. I helped rationalize the short-term experiment roadmap, organized execution, removed roadblocks, and helped ship few of the high potential experiments. Concurrently, I spent time with the executive team to understand their expectations. After observing users and analyzing our logs, I partnered with team leads across Engineering, Design, and Research to develop an updated mission statement and a set of defined success metrics. Within 3 months, we were charging full-speed ahead with an updated roadmap, improvement operational metrics, and significant boost on a platform satisfaction survey. Two years later, the product had been used by hundreds of millions of people every month — 40 times the amount we started with. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated their ability to identify areas of opportunity, backed up by quantifiable results.The answer included important soft skills like collaboration and team-building.
- **Sample answer 4**
  As part of the developing a product roadmap for a CRM product line, I’m proud to have uncovered an unmet need during a user empathy session. One of the pain points that kept coming up was around the end customers spending too much time and effort in creating nested workflows for their activity-based marketing campaigns. I Identified a way to do a rapid prototype of a ‘workflow’ module using natural language that can be invoked based on voice commands and keywords to create complex workflows. I demonstrated the idea and prototype to leadership to obtain support, then met with one of the key engineering leads to develop a timetable to develop this concept without risking the other features on the roadmap. In 2016, we filed a new patent in natural language processing. This capability can be a ‘plug-in’ module to several first party and third party software products that are focused on business process automation and workflows — which has generated a steady stream of licensing revenue to date. Why this answer worked well:The candidate highlighted their ability to discover opportunities and innovate new solutions.The success of the patent was a win for both customers and the company.

## **What would your co-workers say about you?**

## Overview

Interviewers want to know if you’ll fit in with the team. This question can also help you highlight your strengths without feeling like you’re bragging.

- **Sample answer 1**
  I think my coworkers would tell you that I'm the one you turn to when it's time to make sure everyone stays motivated and on track to pull off big, high-profile projects. In one of my LinkedIn recommendations, my supervisor refers to me as the “Human Glue”, which is something I'm proud of. She gave me that nickname after we went through a complex ERP implementation. It was one of those stressful time-critical projects that required the team to come together and make things happen in a short amount of time. I kept the crew going, sometimes through long evening and weekend hours, and inspired them to bring their absolute best to the project everyday. I think that they also appreciated the pizza and donuts I brought in too. Why this answer worked well:He shared something specifically related to the job.He pointed the interviewer to a supervisor's favorable LinkedIn recommendation.He shared a bit of humor.
- **Sample answer 2**
  I would expect that most coworkers would describe me as driven. When I join teams or start on projects, I spend a lot of time understanding what’s most important about the work, which is a huge motivating factor for me. Once I lock in on what matters most, I share it with the team so we’re all invested with a common purpose. Being driven allows me to share what some have called my “infectious enthusiasm” with others and rally the team, and also means that I spend a lot of time with my work to make sure it’s done well. My teams have solid track records of hitting if not exceeding their goals because of this focus and ability to motivate. A good example was when I was working with quite a large group, and our project was given to us top-down. This didn’t feel empowering for the team, but I worked with leadership and our user research team to help the engineers and designers recognize the value of what we were working on. It was slated to be a multiyear project, but because the team was motivated and we focused on creating specifications for the product, we were able to deliver a prototype in just a few months. Why this answer worked well:The answer painted a picture of a strong, motivating team member.The candidate detailed how their strength directly benefited their employer.
- **Sample answer 3**
  My coworkers have told me that I am a technical leader who sets ambitious goals, reliably delivers work on time, and shows empathy to each team member. In a recent peer review, I received great feedback for being a team player. One of my coworkers needed to take some time off to address some pressing personal issues. He wasn’t comfortable asking, as we were working on a very tight timeline and everyone had limited bandwidth — especially me. But knowing that he would be stronger in his role and that the team would be healthier if he was given space to handle outside concerns, I offered to take up his responsibilities for 3 weeks. It was a stretch, but I knew it was temporary. I emphasized time management and prioritization to ensure that no deadlines were missed. When he returned, he was able to focus and our team was even more productive. Why this answer worked well:The candidate utilized a blend of soft and technical skills, and the success was supported by peer review.The example suggests that the candidate would be a strong team player and good culture fit.
- **Sample answer 4**
  Years ago, I read a book called Seeing Yourself as Others Do. The book posits that while we are young in our careers, we can get away with being aggressive in our work style and stepping on toes to get things done. However, as we progress, we’re inevitably tasked with more responsibilities than we could ever handle alone. At this point, it becomes imperative to have the support of those around us — whether or not they are direct reports. I have taken this message seriously and built relationships with people all over the organization. I regularly meet with people from other departments who I don’t normally work with. Because of this strong foundation, I am comfortable picking up the phone and asking for help from a large network of colleagues. And it isn’t just one way! I regularly get calls requesting help and advice on a wide array of projects. As such, I would expect that my coworkers would say that I’m personable, supportive, hard-working, and thoughtful. We spend more time with our co-workers than we do our own families, so it’s important to keep professional relationships strong for team morale and success. Why this answer worked well:The answer highlighted an interest in career growth and meaningful investment of time.Relationship-based examples indicate strong collaborative skills.

You should come off as someone who is looking forward, not backward. Portray your interests more in the light of what you want to get out of your next role.

**Bring it back to them.**

Show them that you’ve done your homework about their company, and relate what you tell them back to the specific job you're interviewing for.

## Overview

Employers want to get a sense of what ‘challenging’ means to you. They also want to know how you handled the situation in a calm way. They’re looking for a storyline to prove that you can turn a bad story into a good story.

- **Sample answer 1**
  In my current role, I was in charge of leading a major marketing campaign for a new product launching nationwide. The project was challenging both because of how large it was and because it involved constant communication with at least seven teams inside my company. Even though I tried to share the same information with everyone, it was clear that not everyone was on the same page. Partway through, I discovered that some of the teams were not on schedule with their assigned tasks. The implications were significant, and a delay to the campaign would negatively impact our revenue goals. I identified the root causes of the delays and set up a plan of action to address them. I planned in-depth one-on-one meetings with the team leaders to help re-inspire them. We talked about the goals and set ambitious targets for getting these last items across the finish line. I then organized and led status-update calls for the larger team and implemented a public dashboard to keep everyone accountable. In the end, we did meet the marketing campaign deadlines and the product launch was a hit. The company hit their revenue goals and everyone on the sales team received a well-deserved bonus. Why this answer worked well:She told us about the potential for serious negative consequences.She described concrete action steps she took to overcome this challenge.She shared the positive results of her actions.

  I was brought into a project right before the ramp, when the existing team ran into a blocker issue. They were severely constrained in both resources and time, and didn’t have the bandwidth to address it. Obviously, there was a lot at stake. The expectation was that I would quickly solve the issue, but I was coming in completely cold and the team was stressed and resistant to stop what they were doing to bring me up to speed. Success required two things. First, I needed to clearly explain exactly what I needed from each team member — and why. Second, I needed to gather this information and context as quickly and efficiently as possible. Once the team realized that there was a process in place, they were very responsive. With all the appropriate inputs, I was able to create a plan to solve the issue within just one week. The team just needed a point person to align everyone. Once I did that, we were able to get things back on track and deliver the project on time. Why this answer worked well:The candidate was able to clearly articulate the challenges, requirements for success, and the use of soft and technical skills to solve a problem.The answer indicated a willingness to be adaptable, and the ability to meet aggressive deadlines.

  While working for a major airline, I needed to adjust a financial model that shared revenue between all the airlines in our partnership. The model used a common industry metric, RASM, to calculate unit revenue — based on the number of seats in an aircraft. But without a universal standard for airplane design, this metric favored some partners over others. To fix this issue, I had to establish a standard without unwanted bias. The new system also needed to be set by an unbiased party. I reached out to contacts I had at our OEMs asking for support. Only a few firms build the majority of all aircraft, and each offered to have their engineering teams create a standard for my purposes. The challenge came from several obstacles: the incredible depth of detail down to every last square foot of each aircraft in our fleet, close communication with partners and suppliers, clear direction for both business leaders and technical engineers, and the need to rally all partners to a cause that would benefit the collective. Overall, clear communication and persistent attention to detail powered the successful completion of this project. Why this answer worked well:The level of detail demonstrated deep subject matter expertise.The candidate showed the ability to break down problems into smaller manageable pieces, creating a clear path forward that takes pros and cons into consideration.

  I was tasked with implementing a uniform data platform for a large, multinational company with tens of thousands of employees. It had to be done in such a way that it could be used by teams spread out all over the world. There were several challenges associated with implementing a platform of this size and importance. We had to make sure the platform would be well-adopted, add value, and be approved by the executive team. Besides the technical complexities of building such a platform, this project was also challenging because we had to influence global teams. To accomplish this, I created a high-level strategy. Then, I asked Senior VPs to nominate reports to form one global team that could represent the entire organization. Ultimately, we succeeded in building a platform that was adopted globally, thanks to a strategic plan executed by a collaborative task force that incorporated both global needs and local aspirations. Why this answer worked well:Leading a project of global scale demonstrates the ability to provide high-level strategy while being capable of localizing the executions.The candidate detailed the complications of the project and the action steps taken.

  When I first joined the company, I noticed that the existing monthly budgeting process was quite time-consuming and inefficient because it was highly manual. There were errors and inaccuracies, and I took the initiative to implement a new budgeting template to automate the process and make it simpler. I developed automated calculations using Excel and fill-in-the-blank lines for departments to submit their numbers. Then I designed and led a training for all relevant staff. The new system made it easier for the departments to provide their budgets in an error-free way. Overall, we had 25% fewer errors in the next cycle of budgets and my team became 30% more efficient. My manager gave me a very strong review for the quarter and noted that she appreciated my initiative to automate and make the process a lot less cumbersome.

  In my role on the innovation strategy team, I helped create a long-term innovation pipeline which led to multiple product launches for a critical business unit. While the company was a market leader in the space, we had been rapidly losing market share over the last few years. My first action was to identify the root cause of our declines. Through a detailed analysis, I identified that our product lineup didn’t fully satisfy evolving consumer needs. I also examined our past product launches and found that they’d lacked differentiated utility. I got approval from leadership to take an end-to-end approach using design thinking. We started with consumer immersions to understand how our products are used and which barriers we’d need to overcome. From there, we created new product concepts. We tested the concepts with consumers and created a long-term innovation pipeline. Finally, we partnered with cross-functional teams to charter and launch 3 products in just 2 years. This increased market share for the first time in 5 years, and we have seen sustained sales growth ever since. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to think critically, develop a strategy, and execute a plan.The answer showed how those efforts led to a positive business result.

  Only a few months into my role, I was asked to lead another product area because the team hadn’t been successful after several attempts. I realized that the org itself posed a challenge. We were essentially operating as 3 separate teams on 3 different sites, in 3 different time zones. So, my first step was to visit each site to build trust and learn more about their priorities, since we would need buy-in from each team. Next, I collaborated with the horizontal metrics team to determine a metric that would capture the value of the project, as well as each individual team’s success. We assembled a team that consisted of engineers from each site and kicked off the project together. We set up a regular travel schedule to support this new team dynamic. When we hit technical issues, we were able to iterate quickly. I’m really proud of the final product for a number of reasons: It was a hot potato that had failed multiple times. And the result is awesome. Not only by our numbers, but I personally know tons of people who really love using it. Finally, I was able to build meaningful relationships with multiple senior stakeholders. Why this answer worked well:The candidate’s involvement was directly connected to the success of the project.The answer clearly outlined the problem solving steps, and showed dedication, and subject matter expertise.
- **Sample answer 4**
  In the last year, I led the launch of an entirely new e-commerce business channel within my company. Data showed us that users have a tendency to impulse buy on social media — and I saw an opportunity to embed a shopping feature in our social media app. With just a lean team of two analysts, I led a 6 month research project in which we interviewed 100 people on how they use social media, exploring their interest and intent when they saw a product image. I also had in-depth conversations with leaders of engineering, user research, and data scientists to understand what would be required to build this feature. Finally, we developed a cost analysis that detailed the resources and manpower we’d need to create a new division. The preparation and research provided a strong enough case to be approved at the highest levels of leadership. The company implemented this new business channel and revenue stream, and I’m really proud to have played a key role in a huge growth moment. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated abilities to distill insights, identify key opportunity areas, and create actionable recommendations that led to new revenue streams.The answer included the detailed steps taken to execute a strategy.

  Yes, so a few years ago I was working in Seattle as a global finance manager. I loved my job and got to travel all over the world. My dad, who lives in Michigan, was diagnosed with dementia that same year, and my mom was having a hard time giving him the level of care he needed. I decided to put my career on pause and go help them. I not only got to spend quality time with my parents and sister, but I was able to get their finances in order so that when it was time for him to enter a care home, they were in a great spot to afford it. He's doing really well at the facility, so now I can refocus on my career.

  Looking at my resume, you’ll notice I have an employment gap of 5 months. I was relocating internationally and had to go through the administrative process of procuring my travel visa and work authorization permits. During this time, I couldn’t legally be employed abroad. The time off was a blessing. It allowed me to recharge my batteries and use the time to stay current with industry and consumer trends. I took the opportunity to evaluate my career journey and make sure I was working towards my long-term goal of being a multinational general manager. Without the day-to-day hustle, I was able to be introspective and distill the lessons I’d taken away in previous roles, and start planning my intentions for the next. I also used the time to read up on the latest developments in design thinking and innovation, and even took a couple online courses in these spaces.

  The 2-month gap on my resume was intentional. I wanted to leave space to prepare for a big international move and take the opportunity to travel. I’d been heads-down for much of my career, and this seemed like an ideal time to unplug. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, I didn’t end up moving or traveling, and the new job fell through. I’ve used the time to brush up on my Spanish through online tutoring, practice some new recipes, and make my way through a reading list that’s relevant for my next role. I have also spent time thinking deeply about the contributions I’d like to make in the next chapter of my career and develop some concrete goals.

  After experiencing a layoff, I created a list of things I wanted to accomplish with the time. I had always wished for more time for creative pursuits like fiction writing, so I spent time developing a TV pilot and framework for a 10 episode arc. Letting my creative juices flow was very rewarding. I found the routine to be therapeutic, and the experience of creation to be invigorating. I also researched companies I was interested in and kept a running list of job requirements that mirrored my own qualifications. I created a document that I could forward to a hiring manager that complimented my resume, highlighting specific skills and real-life experience. This exercise prompted me to evaluate my goals and skills, and to hone in on my next move. The time was well spent. I harnessed my creative side, found inspiration, and created a tailored plan that truly captured my career ambitions.

### **Answer framework**

Most people are nervous about how a gap will be perceived—even if there's a good explanation, But if they’ve invited you in for an interview, then the gap hasn’t ruled you out. Here are some tips on how to discuss it:

**Be honest.**

The truth will set you free. Try to put the situation into the best light and don't lie; it's bound to come back and haunt you. So if your job was eliminated through a merger, just say so.

**Speak with confidence.**

For example, if you had taken some time away from working, avoid acting like you're embarrassed, apologetic or ashamed. The interviewer is going to pick up on that. Instead, pause and you see how they respond. The more calm, succinct and confident you are, the more at ease the interviewer will be with your answer—and with you.

**Show the benefits of your time off.**

Bring up the good that came out of that time whether you were laid off, stepped away to be with family, or even got fired. It's a great way to reframe the situation and an opportunity to showcase some useful skills that you gained during that time.

## Tips

- Expect that they will ask about the gap - prepare for it.
- Answer honestly and strategically.
- Be confident and succinct.
- Shine a light on the good that came out of that time.

## **What are your salary expectations?**

## Overview

If this question arises early, odds are that the interviewer is really asking: “Can we afford you?” If it arises much later, the interviewer may be hoping that your salary requirements are aligned to what they have budgeted for this role.

- **Sample answer 1**
  I've been doing some research on the market for the role of Sales Analyst. What I found from LinkedIn's salary tool is that here in Chicago, base pay for these jobs tends to run between $61,000 and $71,000. Half the companies pay bonuses as well. Given the global impact of your company, and the fact that candidates with Master's degrees, like me, are being recruited most heavily, I think we should be looking toward the top end of that range. Why this answer worked well:She started off by giving a salary range instead of a specific number.She brought neutral research to the table, which establishes her as someone who's trustworthy, bold and grounded.She did a credible job of showing why she should be at that higher range, which made her come across as confident and steady.
- **Sample answer 2**
  Based on my current compensation and market research from resources like Glassdoor and levels.fyi, I am seeking a base salary within the range of $[dollar amount] to $[dollar amount]. I’ve seen similar roles that are offering $[dollar amount]. My specific experience and years in the field are closely aligned with this position, making me a strong candidate to be able to jump in and quickly add value. That said, I understand that this base salary range might be on the higher end of the spectrum for a growing company, and I’m willing to consider a lesser base paired with a signing bonus or increase in restricted stock units. My intention is to grow with the company and invest myself in its success. Why this answer worked well:The answer was well-researched and demonstrated the value that the candidate could add to the company.The candidate provided a base salary range, as well as alternative forms of compensation.
- **Sample answer 3**
  After researching market ranges from multiple sources online and taking into account my education, experience, and location, I’m targeting roles with base salaries in the range of [dollar amount]. Of course, I’m also taking into account opportunities for long-term growth with an emphasis on purpose-driven work as I evaluate and weigh options — and my values are closely aligned with your organization’s mission. For this reason, I would be willing to negotiate base salary in exchange for a generous time-off policy. I intend to be a high performing asset to your company, and value time to recharge when appropriate. Why this answer worked well:The answer showed enthusiasm for the company and its mission.The candidate was prepared with a suggestion that would compensate for a lower base salary.
- **Sample answer 4**
  It’s important to me any new role is positive from a work standpoint. I want the work that I’d be doing to be impactful, and I want to know that I can contribute meaningfully to the organization. That’s why I’m most interested in this role: My personal values and ambitions are aligned with the company’s mission. As far as annual compensation, I’m open to how it is paid out, whether through base salary or a bonus structure. For a move to make sense to me, I would need the total compensation to be between [desired salary range]. Additionally, in future conversations, I’d also like to discuss how we might leverage the signing bonus to compensate for some of the long term Incentives like stock options that I’d be walking away from in my current role. Why this answer worked well:The answer offered a range instead of an exact figure, and suggested several ways that compensation could be structured.The candidate explained the value they’d like to offer the company, and expressed genuine interest in the role.

### **Answer framework**

This is a question you'll get all too often, so here are a few tips to help you master the answer:

**Give them a salary range.**

Let them know there’s room to negotiate (instead of starting with a specific number). Avoid going too low though, because that's going to work against your interests. And don’t go too high either, or you may freeze yourself out of the opportunity.

**Do some neutral research.**

Give them a reasonable place to start from. You can use a resource like the LinkedIn Salary Tool to find out what other companies are paying people in this role and share with them what you learned about this salary range. Then they’ll have to base their compensation at least on those numbers because you've let them know what other similar organizations are giving to employees who do that job.

**Bring up signing bonuses.**

Doing this can create a win-win situation for both parties. At the end of a negotiation, asking for extra money up top is often a way to bridge the gap between what you want and what you’re being offered.

## Tips

- Know the industry norms for similar jobs.
- Talk about ranges, rather than exact numbers.
- Make the case that you offer premium value.

## **What do you like to do outside of work?**

  A lot of my spare time lately has been dedicated to teaching myself how to shoot and edit instructional videos. I've been a garage-sale shopper for several years, and I sell my finds on eBay to pay down my student loan debt. So far I've raised $11,000. People who find out that I do this often have a lot of questions about how to get started, how to find the best stuff, and how to market items on eBay.

  I really love backpacking in different countries, especially with different cultures than the one I grew up in. I find that it allows me to disconnect and recharge from everyday life, while growing and learning something new. To date, I’ve backpacked either alone or with friends in over 20 countries, across Asia, South and Central America. For our honeymoon, my wife and I travelled northern India for 6 weeks. It’s a very diverse region, home to Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists, and we really enjoyed spending time in a few different states. We did a diverse set of activities like hiking the Himalayas and Ladakh, finding cool hot springs, and Vipassana meditation. Vipassan is a 10 days of silence meditation.

  My wife and 5 children are my top priority. As a family, we stay very active and enjoy outdoor activities like camping and waterskiing. I played collegiate soccer and when 3 of my children joined teams, I took up coaching. I became so involved that the city requested my help in building out their recreational soccer training program. I also volunteer with a youth group through our church. I act as a mentor, helping young men set and achieve their own goals. For example, if they want to learn how to do an oil change, I empower them to learn. I’ll help them track down a car, guide them in the research, then oversee the process. As a father and community member, these activities have been enormously rewarding. It’s nice to feel like I’m making a difference in people’s lives. Why this answer worked well:The candidate’s commitment to family, community, and volunteerism shows follow-through.The answer paints a picture of a productive and dependable team player.

### **Answer framework**

With this question, employers are looking to get a feel for your likability and cultural fit. So what should you say—and not say? Here are a few tips.

**Pick one of your favorites.**

Go ahead and share something about your hobbies, volunteer work, or the places you enjoy traveling to. Maybe you're taking classes to help you accelerate your skills. In general, you just want to tell them something that's true and will paint you as an interesting, healthy, or good human being.

**Keep it short.**

For example, if you're a bird watcher in your free time, skip the 22-minute account of every species you've ever documented. Share enthusiastically so your passion shines through, but don't ramble on endlessly. Doing so might give the people to whom you're trying to make a good impression the feeling that you're nervous or that brevity just isn't your strong suit.

**Stick to appropriate topics.**

Avoid anything that might be pulverizing or offends somebody who's not a part of a particular group like politics or religion. Choose something uncontroversial or beneficial, and take advantage of the opportunity to show them that you're the complete package.

## Tips

- Share something that paints a favorable picture.
- Keep it short and sweet.
- Don’t bore them with long stories.
- Steer clear of the inappropriate zone.

## **Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.**

## Overview

Employers want to see how you handle competing priorities, understand the implications of missing deadlines, and can stay cool under pressure.

- **Sample answer 1**
  I was asked at the last minute to help with a major project. The deadline was just a few days away and the project had gotten derailed. As I was working on this first urgent project, I was approached by two different clients with pressing requests as well. These conflicting priorities overwhelmed me at first. Then I came up with a plan to prioritize the tasks I was given based on their level of importance. I determined which clients were the most critical to our business and who needed deliverables with the quickest turnaround. I ranked the assignments and figured out how long it would take me to finish them. Then I checked in with my coworkers, clients, and manager to see if the timeline made sense to them. We added an additional team member, stayed in the office late for a few nights, and aligned with the clients on the new timeline. In the end, I was able to complete everything on time. Each client, manager and co-worker was satisfied with my work and were happy that I communicated my revised timeline so there weren’t any surprises at the end of the project. Why this answer worked well:She explained the many conflicts happening in this particular week at work.She described how she tackled the process and showed what steps she took to get everyone on board with the new timeline.She ranked the assignments based on who the clients were and what they expected. The outcome was positive and the clients were happy.
- **Sample answer 2**
  As part of my role in Business Development, I managed multiple programs. Due to changes in business needs, I had to update the training for the sales team for one program, while working on launching a new capability within the other. Both were high priority and time sensitive, and required major time and effort on my end. To ensure that deadlines were met, I met with the respective internal and external partners to set expectations and key milestones. I also identified which teams would be responsible for the various aspects of each deliverable. Once we established parameters, I stayed in regular communication with all stakeholders. Every time we hit or missed a milestone, we went back to the plan to adjust and realign. The constant open communication kept us all on the same page and working towards the collective goal. We were able to successfully deploy the new capability for one of the programs, which was a big success. Due to factors beyond our control, we missed the deadline for the other program — but our transparent and communicative working model eased conversations with partners and leadership, and allowed us to pivot quickly. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to manage expectations across stakeholders while ensuring alignment throughout multiple projects.The answer highlighted strong communication and project management skills, and the ability to ease challenging conversations.
- **Sample answer 3**
  During my role as Manager of Transportation Procurement, I was tasked with creating reports for procurement and presenting them to our Business Intelligence department. I was selected for the project because of my engineering experience. After creating the reports, the BI team told me that they were backlogged for at least 6 months — which was an unacceptable timeline for my manager. I was hesitant to break protocol, but explained that I could actually design and implement the entire project myself within 6 weeks. To get it done, I logged extra hours each day of the week. I created a power template with all the SQL connection, necessary queries and joins, as well as all the DAX calculations needed. I replicated the template for each report needed and built a dashboard as a web interface for users to access the reports. When I shared this with my boss, I was asked to present it in an upcoming meeting. To my surprise, both the President and VP of the division attended. My hard work was very well received. The next week, I was given a promotion and assigned full responsibility for Business Intelligence. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed a willingness to take on additional responsibilities to accommodate an aggressive timeline.The process and tools used to complete the project reflect deep experience and expertise.The candidate’s promotion provided proof of success and the ability to win the trust of leadership.
- **Sample answer 4**
  When I worked for a technology company in the 3D printing space, their org had me reporting directly to a VP of North American Sales, as well the global VP of Sales based in Tel Aviv. This dotted line structure led to inherent priority conflict, as I was taking direction from 2 different department heads with very different expectations. I was not able to perform my role effectively with multiple managers, and it caused much undue stress. I approached my direct manager of our North American operation and asked that he contact the VP of our corporate location in Israel to request a change in reporting structure. Fortunately, I had already established myself as a valuable, contributing team member. This allowed me to approach this escalation with confidence, as my manager knew I was committed to excellence in my role. It turned out that this was a much larger, company-wide issue, and by bringing my situation to the attention of leadership, a larger conversation about reporting structure began. Ultimately, the company made the decision to phase out the dotted line reporting matrix globally. Why this answer worked well:The answer clearly explained the situation and source of conflict.The candidate had established themselves as a valuable contributor and felt comfortable addressing the issue directly.The resolution had positive implications for the entire company.

## **Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**

## Overview

Employers want to determine how serious you are about your career and whether your goals match the goals for this job. Employers don’t expect you to offer up a specific title you want. Instead, they want to know what you hope to accomplish.

- **Sample answer 1**
  In the first two or three years, I plan to immerse myself in the position by leveraging my strong Excel knowledge to develop automated reports and processes.

  My professional experience has provided a strong foundation and invaluable insight into my strengths, interests, and areas of opportunity. In the next 5 years, my aim is to continue to build strong relationships and trust by establishing myself as an expert in my field.

  I really enjoy my current position and have been happy to contribute to the success of the company. Within the next 5 years, I see myself taking on greater responsibility through a senior leadership role. I feel that my experience, communication skills, and creative strengths would well position me to lead a nationwide or global sales team. At this point in my career, I have already broadened my role by transitioning from a field rep to a regional manager. Under my guidance, the team has grown the regional revenue by 32% in just 15 months. We have also established a continued growth trajectory that projects 15% more growth within the next two quarters.

  In 5 years time, I see myself advancing to an executive level role leading the broader marketing function or leading the company’s effort to be a digital-first brand. That being said, I’ve always seen myself as a business-leader first, marketer second. In order to be a well rounded business leader, and given the global nature of the company, I would like to do an international assignment within the next 2-3 years, ideally in Asia. My experience and expertise to date has been North America-centric and I would like to garner the experience of working in a different culture with different consumers and unique business challenges. China and India have different go-to market business models, higher price sensitivity, smaller pack sizes, all of which requires a different approach and I would like to learn, grow and add value to this important region.

They’re looking for a career with this company, with ambition to succeed beyond the current scope of the role.

### **Answer framework**

The key to answering this question is to focus on what you can give to the employers or the role. Here are three tips:

**Break the time into chunks.**

Let them know what you might do in each two-to-three year period. This helps the interviewer to visualize and see what you're describing. Take them through what you plan to do in the first few years and how you plan to take it up a notch in the years after that.

**Talk about how your goals will help them.**

Paint a vivid picture about the value that you plan to deliver within each of those two-to-three year chunks that you described.

**Avoid talking about job titles.**

Resist the urge to tell them about what you want your position to be in two, three, or five years because that can come off as overly presumptuous.

## Tips

- Break the answer down in two to three year chunks.
- Focus on what you can give, rather than what you can get.
- Don’t bring up a specific job title that you want to move into one day.
- Make it specific to this particular company and position.

## **Describe your leadership style.**

## Overview

Good leaders can explain their values and priorities in a few words. This is a test to see if you can explain yourself. It also helps to determine whether your approach meshes with the company’s own culture.

- **Sample answer 1**
  For me, good leadership is about finding the best analytical approach while still caring about the people on the team. Last year, I took charge of a digital marketing campaign that wasn't getting any traction. I realized our team members didn't know what was expected. We worked together to build new metrics. I gave more responsibilities to our most engaged team member and helped another one find a different job where he could be more effective. Within three months, we were hitting our numbers and morale was vastly better. When we were ready to expand, five internal candidates asked if they could join our team. I love building productive, successful teams, and it sounds as if there would be great opportunities to do that in the job we're talking about. Why this answer worked well:She talked about what her overall philosophy was and how she was an effective leader.She shared an example of something that was a challenge, what she did to solve it, how she brought the team along, and the results that she captured from it.She wrapped it up with how it connected back to the organization.
- **Sample answer 2**
  I subscribe to McGregor’s Theory Y of management, which emphasizes the importance of "participation." This theory suggests that people take pride in their work and act responsibly for the most part. I firmly believe that everyone wants to do their level best, and will do so when they have a clear vision, the right tools, and a sense of ownership. This informs the way I lead and inspires my goal of creating a positive, inclusive, and enabling work environment for everyone involved. In my experience, this approach has kept collaborators highly motivated and delivering work in a way that is sustainable for everyone involved. While working on a small sales team, my focus was to set clear and collective targets to ensure ownership, and offer regular training sessions on selling process and technology use. This was more efficient than having a weekly check-in and feedback cadence. It was a refreshing change for the team who appreciated the autonomy. This approach was successful, as our team consistently delivered above plan revenue while achieving savings on trade allowances. I also received the CEO award for sales excellence and received the highest performance grading. Why this answer worked well:The answer includes their philosophy and a real-life example of how it has been successfully applied.The candidate’s story shows a genuine interest in teams and in building leadership skills.

  In a word, supportive. I think it is important to understand the unique strengths and blind spots of my team members and direct reports. Knowing how to work with a range of experience, skills, and working styles plays a big role in the success of a team. We recently hired a new analyst who had limited experience in the industry and required hand-holding up front, but who we believed would learn fast. To effectively lead, I had to know when to step in and course correct, and when to let them make their own mistakes and learn by experience for maximum growth. Conversely, a contractor I managed in a prior role had significantly more subject matter expertise than I did. I recognized this and positioned myself as a support structure — I helped clear the path for her to achieve her goals. I believe that good leaders pay attention, listen actively, and play to the strengths of each partner and colleague. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed the ability to assess all skill sets on the team to fully optimize projects.The answer detailed the balance of giving direct input versus letting the team explore.

  There are many aspects to my leadership philosophy, but the foundation is psychological safety. Right or wrong, I want to give the people around me, reporting to me, and partnering with me the ability to truly and honestly express their opinions without fearing any retribution or impact. That includes people overtly disagreeing with me, pushing back, or expressing an emotion. I may not always agree with them, but they will always be heard. I have found that this builds a powerful trust on teams because it’s a natural way to engage. When people feel locked in by dogma, they don’t raise their voice, and valuable insights may be lost. By giving everyone I work with psychological safety, they feel respected, understood, and free to contribute authentically. I also believe in decisiveness — in streamlined decision-making that empowers forward movement. We get the data we need, the input required, we have the safe and healthy debates, and make the call. This helps to minimize exhaustion across the board, and let team members put their stamp on real progress. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed the ability to lead teams with divergent points of view, and a willingness to be challenged by new ideas.The candidate demonstrated an understanding of the importance of minimizing exhaustion for the sake of productivity and morale.

### **Answer framework**

This is a question you’ll hear a lot and answering with authenticity is key. Here are three tips I have to help you get started:

**Be clear about your leadership style.**

Don’t be vague or ambivalent. If you're a team builder, say so. If you're tough, but fair, own it. Be very concise and clear on how you define your leadership so that they know very well what you're all about.

**Give a detailed example that highlights it.**

Talk about a situation, a problem or an obstacle, and then walk through what did you do and what was the result. What did it mean to your organization, company, and the customer? And be sure to include how you brought your team along, because this isn't all about you.

**Show situations where you've adapted.**

Life's not going to be simple. People want to see how you've grown and changed given the situation. Just like you look for that in the people you're going to hire, the same thing with the hiring manager who's looking to hire you.

## Tips

- Start by framing your basic style in a few words.
- Give an example of your leadership style in action.
- Show that you can adapt well to unexpected situations.

## **Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake.**

## Overview

Being able to admit to a mistake shows maturity and personal accountability. Employers want to know you’re self-aware and that you learn from past experiences. Errors are inevitable in any job - it’s how you handle them that matters.

- **Sample answer 1**
  In my first job, my manager asked me to develop several forms of tracking projects. I said “yes” because I wanted to do everything my manager asked me to do. But as I started working on the project, I realized I didn't understand the overall goal. And the project ended up creating templates that didn't meet my manager's expectations. My manager was disappointed in me. She told me that if I had asked some clarifying questions, I would've gotten to a better work product. I admitted to my manager that I had made a mistake and learned that it doesn't make you look stupid if you ask clarifying questions. I learned that it's better to speak up quickly. That's how I've handled those situations ever since. Why this answer worked well:She owned her mistake, going straight to the point and describing a situation with the right level of detail.She reflected on what she did wrong—not asking clarifying questions—and how that negatively impacted her work.She talked about what she learned from the experience.
- **Sample answer 2**
  During my first few months in network planning, I worked to launch a new international route for a major airline. Months of work and detailed analysis goes into every new route as many candidates are narrowed down to a few worthy of a multi-million dollar investment. Regardless, this work needs to be done at a rapid pace and with a high level of confidentiality. My team moved quickly, and my work was shared with only a few key decision makers in the company to gain approval. Unfortunately, throughout the rapid pace of work, a few key stakeholders were left out of communications and felt unprepared. They were later left to scramble and quickly adapt when they heard about my project in the media. Learning from my mistake, I developed a robust checklist of each communication that would be required prior to all subsequent launches. I also adapted it for other teams to help my peers avoid a similar oversight. Why this answer worked well:The candidate addressed the question honestly, and described actions taken to avoid repeating the mistake.Adapting the solution for peers shows the candidate’s dedication to the company, and indicates a team player mentality.
- **Sample answer 3**
  While working in channel sales for a technology company that sold storage area network solutions, I made the mistake of announcing a new break/fix service that was not approved or rolled out internally yet. I had jumped the gun in assuming it was ready to go. As a result, over 50 global channel partners received the new program and some of them had already initiated quotes for end users. Once I realized my mistake, I sent out communication to the channel partners and owned up to it fully. Many reached out to me directly and were understandably confused and frustrated, but appreciated the transparency. I offered to speak to their customers and help with any quotes that may have been stuck. Ultimately, we were able to roll out the product fairly shortly thereafter, and there were no serious consequences. But I had learned my lesson. Since then, I’ve made more regular and effective communication a top priority. I make myself available and accessible to internal and external partners to keep a steady stream of information and updates flowing to avoid preventable errors. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed that they are willing to hold themselves accountable and take direct action to solve problems.The answer outlined steps taken to avoid similar mistakes in the future, demonstrating a learning mentality.

  As a second year digital executive at a leading snacks brand, I had an opportunity to either renew past sponsorships or seek new opportunities to associate our brand with top sports and entertainment properties. When I extended our contracts in fantasy football, I had my doubts of the effectiveness of the partnership and the overall lack of novelty after so many years. Compared to the actual NFL, fantasy football has a limited number of extremely dedicated fans and users. We had a true tradeoff of reach versus frequency. I worked with our agency partners to slash costs and develop numerous versions of compelling sweepstakes. We refreshed the creative constantly and monitored performance aggressively to avoid a negative ROI. But, despite all efforts, we struggled to get fans to engage. I wish I had trusted the numbers and my own intuition to consider other programs that would have been a much bigger success. It’s not easy to quickly acclimate at a top CPG company, but that experience taught me to bet on myself, seek mentors who can help guide me in a new culture, and never forget the importance of thanking teammates and partners for their hard work. Why this answer worked well:The candidate took initiative to keep the work on track, but also owned the underperformance.The answer set up the challenge and detailed the range of strategies that were attempted.

### **Answer framework**

Respond to this kind of question with a compelling story that uses the "SAR" framework: situation, action, and results.

**Describe the situation.**

Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.

**Get into the action.**

Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.

**Show the results.**

Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.

## Tips

- Use an honest example that’s believable.
- Explain why it was a mistake.
- Talk about what you’ve learned and any steps you’ve taken to show that you’re “working on it”.

## **Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person.**

## Overview

Employers know that difficult people are everywhere and situations come up frequently. Explaining how you’ve been able to handle a challenging person in a mature way demonstrates your ability to manage difficult moments successfully.

- **Sample answer 1**
  My boss assigned me to a big project that entailed working across multiple teams. I had to collect and analyze data that would help her make an informed decision about a new service we were introducing to our customers. One of these individuals I needed to collect data from had a bit of a difficult personality. He was late to provide the data, and when he did provide it, it was incomplete or inaccurate. Without getting the right information from him I knew I wouldn't be able to complete my assignment. After I asked a few times, he agreed to have coffee with me so we could talk about the situation and I could get a better sense of what his challenges were. I asked what I could do to help make the request easier for him. He shared that he was overwhelmed, as he had multiple competing deadlines, and that there were errors and delays with all the data. We brainstormed ways that I could break down my request into more bite-size chunks so he could squeeze in the request in between bigger projects. I then customized each of my requests in a way that would work with his schedule. He appreciated how much I was able to tailor my request to meet his needs. And ultimately, he helped me complete my assignments on time. Why this answer worked well:She described a tough situation and the difficulties that she experienced with this person.She explained the action steps she took and its positive outcome.She took the time to understand this individual's issues, which is a crucial skill you need when working with others.

  My company had kicked off a highly controversial cross-functional initiative. I was the project lead with a team of three Product Managers, though I was not their direct manager. One of the Product Managers was many years my senior and a level above me in the organization. Throughout the process, I found that he was working around me, looping me out, and stalling the process by surfacing problems without recommending solutions. I set aside time for us to chat directly. I shared some of the challenges and pressure I was facing, making myself vulnerable to create space for him to be receptive. I explained the tension I was feeling with regards to our working relationship and asked what I could do to help improve the situation. This allowed us to clear the air, identify issues, brainstorm solutions, and commit to a healthier form of partnership moving forward. It was a powerful reminder of the value of communication and the importance of transparency and honesty on teams. Seeing one another in a humanizing light allowed us to build a stronger team. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated strong leadership with the ability to “manage up” when team members have seniority.The answer outlined important soft skills like problem solving, communication, and emotional intelligence.
- **Sample answer 3**
  As a Business Analyst, my job was to create requirements documents or pitches for new projects to present to a board of directors for approval. One of the board members was notorious for poking holes and asked us to gather more information, causing significant delays. This made stakeholders very unhappy. I reached out to this board member to better understand his concerns and identify ways to streamline the process. I looked back at the proposals and identified three themes of concern that kept coming up. We ran proposed changes by the board, and then modified the template accordingly. We also implemented a new practice to share the proposals with the board before meetings to stay ahead of questions. Our approval rates tripled! In the end, uncovering the root of a difficult relationship was beneficial to our process and all parties involved. Why this answer worked well:The answer shows that the candidate has a proactive problem-solving mentality and is capable of turning challenges into opportunities.Resolving this difficulty prevented delays for future projects and improved collaboration with board members and stakeholders.

  I don’t really believe that there are inherently difficult people. In my experience, different backgrounds and levels of information can make it difficult to understand another’s point of view. As a product manager, I really wanted to push for a shopping feature within our app. I saw a great opportunity to open a new potential revenue stream, but one of our key stakeholders — an engineering team lead — was concerned that we’d need to staff up in a significant way, and that the investment wouldn’t pay off. I did a little digging and spoke to his team members to understand his concerns better. I realized that I would need a quantitative analysis, rather than just a business plan. So I mapped out potential revenue to prove that this endeavor would not only be profitable in the short term, but over the next 5 years. He was impressed that I had run the same analytics as his engineering team would, which helped him move from a blocker to a strong advocate of the project. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed a willingness to work through a difficult relationship by understanding another point of view.The approach was a blend of soft and technical skills, and the result was a clear win for the company.

## Overview

This question is all about sizing up your emotional intelligence. Interviewers are looking for problem solvers, not shouters. Strong answers showcase your listening skills and your ability to guide people to better choices.

- **Sample answer 1**
  The day before a major management review, I was told we only had ten minutes to present our project. We had originally been promised fifteen. Most of our team members agreed to shorten their remarks. One person refused to make changes. I suggested that we sit down over coffee and talk about it. I started by listening, letting him explain how hard he'd worked. I realized the issue wasn't about the length of his speech but more about him being recognized for doing a thorough job and getting his presentation together. He was proud of his work. So, we talked about another way of recognizing his efforts by acknowledging him in our team newsletter. When we wrapped up that part of the conversation, he volunteered to shorten his part of his speech. By treating his contributions with respect, I guided him to a better outcome. Why this answer worked well:He created an alternate path that supported this coworker’s goal without wrecking the entire project.He summed it up well at the end showing how he can be persuasive without dominating the conversation.

  At a key moment in my previous role, my team was trying to balance the growth of our user base and safety of users. We were exploring many solutions for this problem, and my role was to align the team. Our engineering manager had a strong perspective on a solution that was technically straightforward, but did not fully address both needs. Our designer wanted to implement a more complicated, but comprehensive solution. I believed that the latter seemed like the appropriate course of action, but it needed an additional layer of depth to fully address concerns from all parties. First, I partnered with the designer to outline the solution and create a framework that detailed key benefits and potential downsides. Next, I brought in an engineering counterpart to break down the costs and timing implications of building a comprehensive solution. These inputs enabled a strong case for the more complicated, but ultimately more meaningful solution. Enthusiastic team alignment made timely leadership buy-in possible. While I had to invest more detail work upfront, we were able to shave off a few weeks by broadening our technical brainstorms throughout the early stages — which allowed us to complete the project ahead of schedule Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to identify project gaps and build a strong case towards the more optimal solution.The answer clearly outlined the approaches and strategies behind each action, which ultimately lead to improved efficiency and timely delivery.

  I had just started leading special projects for the CEO of our wholesale division. He was very particular about data models and gave line-item feedback, which caused extra work for the team. I felt strongly that there was a better way to complete the work. My boss and I pitched a new model, but it was shot down. I realized that he needed to see it in action. During the next review, I showed the old model and the CEO listed his changes. I then pulled out my new model and showed him all of the options he was able to clarify. He was surprised that I could modify variables so quickly to give him immediate feedback. He wasn’t an unreasonable person, he just had a system that worked for him. We made a successful, time-saving update because I took the time to understand his motivations, learn how to speak his language, and find a solution to his pain points. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed strategic thinking and perseverance in taking the time to convince leadership to adopt a new approach.The solution demonstrates the candidate’s ability to identify valuable process improvements.

  As a software engineer, I had to persuade my marketing and sales teams that deploying a new version of the software was the right thing for our consumers and clients because the existing version was vulnerable to cyber attacks. The teams were against a new version because they believed it would cause client dissatisfaction. Additionally, these security enhancements came with a 23% cost increase. To reframe the value equation, I took three steps. First, I enrolled leading cyber attack experts to educate everyone on the impending risks from foreign entities. This reinforced the urgent business imperative of investing in secured systems. Next, I partnered with my finance team and determined that the cost of “fixing” systems after an attack amounted to a 77% increase in spend — to say nothing of intangibles like reputational damage. Finally, I hired a market research group to bring a group of "non-techy" folks to conduct a live, in-person demo of our new interface. The group demonstrated the new software with ease. Marketing and sales were so convinced that they asked me to join them in key client meetings to lead the sales pitch myself. Clients not only loved the new system, but revenues increased by 32% with the development of a premium version. Why this answer worked well:The answer clearly laid out the scenario, challenges, and steps.The candidate’s actions were a blend of strategic, cross-functional, and technical skills, resulting in quantifiable success.

## Overview

Occasional conflicts are a fact of life. Interviewers want to see if you can work through those tensions in a respectful way. If you helped steer things toward a good compromise, that’s a big plus. Signs of anger or bitterness will count against you.

- **Sample answer 1**
  My team was given a new goal: to sell our product to a new customer segment that we hadn’t served in the past. The group had strong opinions about the approach we should take. In spite of their voices, I had concerns about their strategy; I thought it may fail as it didn't align with the client’s core needs. But I was in the minority and when I spoke up I wasn't heard. I needed to find another way to make the case to my teammates. I set up a focus group with a potential client so my team could understand the challenges and priorities of the people we aimed to serve. The great news was they saw that our planned product wouldn't meet these needs, but if we made some slight adjustments to the service, we could deliver something of real value. The team rallied behind this and got on board. We were ultimately successful in bringing this client onboard—and ten more! Why this answer worked well:She shared a succinct example of a time when her opinion was in the minority.She came up with a creative way to change her team’s perspective.She used this new strategy and described how well it worked.

  During my time on the growth strategy team, I partnered with various brand and finance teams to create a promotion and events calendar to maximize portfolio performance. This was especially challenging because each brand team was only responsible for their brand’s performance, while my job was to help ensure that the entire portfolio succeeds. This created an inherent discord in the exercise. In the past, teams would look back at the previous year’s events with the goal of essentially replicating them. It occurred to me that this may not be the most efficient way to plan the calendar, since the process didn’t involve any real evaluation of success. My partners were reluctant to let go of the existing process. To get buy-in, I prepared two scenarios. One used the old approach. The other used my new suggested approach with event evaluation criteria — showing both the monthly and total year sales estimate for each brand, as well as the entire portfolio. To make sure my case was airtight, I’d pre-worked with other cross-functional teams to ensure that the new projections were compatible with monthly product supply numbers and trade allowances. I was able to get buy-in and implement the new process, which has allowed us to factor in accurate estimates, measure success, and increase the efficiency of event planning. Why this answer worked well:The answer demonstrated the candidate’s ability to evaluate and optimize an existing process, using data and key performance metrics.The candidate showed flexibility in his approach through scenario planning, seeking a win-win solution for all partners.The outcome was a more strategic process and a net positive for the company.

  A few years ago, I was asked to give a presentation on best practices in procuring transportation. One of my suggestions was to change the lane hierarchy for which we procure rates as well as changing the hierarchy we used to build routing guides in our transportation management system. The Director of Transportation did not agree, which created some tension. I explained to the leadership team how the change would allow us to capture all the operational requirements and help carriers to know exactly where they are sending trucks. I quickly realized that the director was concerned that the change would require more personnel and thus more budget. So, I created a presentation to detail how the new plan could save up to 5%, which would help cover more than 2 additional temporary employees. That convinced the team. Ultimately, my plan did even better than expected, with a savings of 7% — approximately 34 million dollars. As a result, I was given more latitude on future procurement-related decisions, in which I employed target pricing and multi-year deals that saved the company even more. Why this answer worked well:The answer laid out the challenge clearly and quantified success.The candidate demonstrated the ability to dive into stakeholders’ concerns and create consensus.The answer highlighted both soft and technical skills utilized to solve a conflict and improve the company’s bottom line.

  My organization had prioritized the growth of a certain part of the business, and we were all in a room discussing the best way to drive it. The cross-functional group had starkly different opinions. One senior level team member suggested that we “force” the customers to make necessary changes by threatening to pull funding. This set off warning sirens in my mind because my team would be responsible for carrying this out. I responded by acknowledging his idea as a novel approach. Then I mentioned that in the past I’d found it effective to offer incentives — rather than threats — to solve a problem or close a gap. I suggested that we offer the customer promotions in Q4 if they were able to execute our new strategy by Q3. I wanted to shift the conversation in a more positive direction and discuss ideas that would be mutually beneficial. It worked, and the group began to brainstorm which customer pain points we could help solve, and how we could inspire their cooperation. We ended up giving them additional incremental promotions, as well as participating in one of their corporate events. Not only did we solve their Q4 gap, but we grew our business by 2.3% that year. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to manage a potentially confrontational project by successfully aligning all stakeholders and guiding them towards an alternate solution.The solution offered was customer-centric, and still managed to increase the company’s bottom line.

  In my line of work, most top performers have MBAs. I couldn't afford to step out of the workforce for two years to earn one. But I promised myself to do everything possible to earn an MBA within three years while working full-time. I found a top-rated online program and started setting my alarm clock for 5:30 a.m. I set goals of two hours of study time in the morning and evening, and made detailed to-do lists to manage both my study schedule and my other work responsibilities. It was incredibly hard, but I persisted and managed every minute of my day—and achieved my goal.

  I was two weeks into my first role with a new company when the leader of our business unit requested to showcase all the technology my team was working on, plus two brand new demos in the grand opening of our New York City office — in just six weeks. My manager tagged me to lead the charge. Most of our projects weren’t client-ready, which would mean lots of coding and testing to do in a short period of time. I don’t think anyone thought we’d have it 100% ready in time. I gathered the team and explained to them that we had a really cool opportunity, and asked for their ideas. I didn’t sugarcoat how hard it would be, but promised to do everything I could to clear the path. In the next few weeks, I quickly re-prioritized our Jira backlog to put other non-critical projects on pause and communicated to those stakeholders. I then implemented weekly sprints and daily standups to reduce meeting overhead and increase the time available for them to code and test in pairs. And to keep up morale, I requested funds from leadership to sponsor dinners for the team when they worked late, and even secured travel funds so that our developers could attend the opening. Through careful re-prioritization, open communication and keeping the morale high, we were able to successfully deliver the demo as the result. Why this answer worked well:The candidate was realistic about the challenge, but created a clear plan to meet the timeline.The candidate demonstrated leadership by encouraging morale and securing a team reward.

  While working as a digital analyst for a top snack brand, sales growth had been slowing for our company. After discovering that our key customers - people between 16-24 year-olds - were heavily over-indexing on mobile, I persuaded the team to execute a massive pivot: shifting 25% of our digital spending towards top mobile channels. We began to liaise with leading sports platforms and leveraged their flagship app. Envisioning true integrations, not just tiny banners that go unnoticed, we began to gain stakeholder buy-in through casual pop-ins with senior leadership — so that by the time we had a solid plan, approval was already implied. We inked multi-year deals as their top sponsor to block out competitors in this emerging space. We received so many mobile impressions that I personally rolled up my sleeves and flew to Kansas City to meet with our digital creative agency to brainstorm a content roadmap tailored to top markets, levering our existing sports relationships and assets in each geography. This program was a strong performer, delivering tons of value, reaching a coveted audience, and gaining industry awards that boosted the profiles of marketing leadership. It also helped me reinforce that new channels can be great opportunities if you just remember the basics: It’s all about reaching the right customer at the right time. Why this answer worked well:The candidate met a difficult challenge with a bold and innovative approach.The candidate demonstrated the ability to provide high-level strategy while being mindful of executional details.The willingness to see projects through personally showed dedication.

  As a marketing executive in the beer industry, we faced a tough challenge when data showed that our top male consumer group started drinking less beer and more spirits. Historically, the beer industry has never catered to women, which created a market share gap of over 30 points between male and female drinkers. I set a goal to reduce this gap by at least 10 points and create a $2 million opportunity for the business. This required an all new marketing approach. First, I made the case to senior management by highlighting the existential threat facing the company. Second, I chartered a small, multi-functional team of marketing, sales, finance, and supply chain to develop a holistic plan across packaging, design, and in-store merchandising. Third, I hired a female-led ad agency to create a campaign that would inspire women without alienating men. Authenticity was key, and our existing agency was not the right partner for this work. Lots of these actions were controversial at the time, but timely engagement, continuous learning, iterations, and a high degree of accountability won out. The results were huge: A 15 point reduction in market share gap which exceeded our goal, an innovative platform that lets us target other user groups, and 5 Cannes Lions awards. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed the ability to identify opportunity areas and create innovative solutions.The answer included challenges, clear steps, and results that surpassed expectations.

- **Sample answer 1**
  As a young professional, I was given a small event to manage for my company's senior executives. We originally expected about 50 attendees, but then the CEO decided to participate too. Suddenly, the event became much bigger with 400 people attending. We had to organize buses, food, scripted content, speeches and the program itself. I stepped up and designed carefully crafted messaging documents for each stakeholder; had weekly check-ins with each group; and ran volunteer training sessions to be sure that all the logistics ran smoothly. I learned the importance of careful planning and constant practice; two habits that paid off on many projects since then. The event is now considered the most successful of our division. My boss praised my work for going far beyond what she expected when the project was first assigned. Why this answer worked well:She painted a picture of how she approached a new problem.She explained how she adjusted throughout to meet challenges as they arose.She described the successful outcome and its implications for her job.

  In my role as Business Analyst, I was responsible for analyzing and implementing strategies for key products. Due to a combination of an organizational restructuring and employee attrition, my team of four shrunk down to a team of two: my new leader and me. At this stage, I combined some key skill sets. I used my technical expertise to create and automate new models that would capture potential opportunities, and my ability to communicate complicated results in simple language to support our sales team’s efforts. The automation led to greater efficiency, and my communication and relationship-building skills helped the sales team create client-specific onboarding strategies. This enabled us to continue to keep the business going with minimal impact. I was recognized by senior leadership for being able to pivot quickly in unpredictable circumstances and make the most of a difficult situation. Why this answer worked well:The candidate used both soft and technical skill sets to maintain output with reduced headcount.The answer demonstrated a growth mindset by showing adaptability, innovation, and the willingness to rethink how their role can be done.

  I had only been in my new role at a leading professional services firm for a few months when I got the call: “Can you make it to Atlanta tomorrow morning for a pitch meeting with a leading telecom company? We need all hands on deck!” It turned out that the senior management closest to this client couldn’t make the meeting, so I led an 8-figure pitch. I leaned on my public speaking and presentation skills to carry the meeting and make a strong impression. I painted a picture of how we were uniquely qualified as the best partner for this piece of business, and peppered in some humility to make the firm look more “human.” On our way back to the airport, a senior leader from our firm who had come along for optics told me that people at my level were not nearly this polished, and that he would welcome me to future pitches to all of his clients. It felt great to have exceeded the expectations of this very senior leader and this incident set me on a path to success at the firm. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to quickly and reliably take ownership when needed.The answer highlighted strong presentation skills, a positive attitude, and willingness to be flexible.

  I had been in my new role within the organization for just one week. My predecessor had left the relationship with our customer in a questionable place and as a result, they informed us that they’d be working with our top competitor instead. We’d found the work to be very impactful and needed a plan to win the customer back. I worked with my team to identify the customer’s pain points, then we began re-engagement efforts. At the beginning, the engagements were only by email, but soon I began getting phone calls from senior leaders asking if we could help them to solve these problems. After 7 months, the customer asked if we still had the headcount to support them. We came to discover that many of the presentations we’d shared had circulated through other parts of their organization. A few months later, the customer’s senior leadership asked me to expand my team so that we could increase our scope and do more of this work in other categories where we sold products. We did, and our sales have continued to grow in double digits for the last 2 years. Needless to say, the relationship with the customer is stronger than ever. Why this answer worked well:The answer details how the candidate walked into a challenging situation, created a plan, and increased business as a result.The solution utilized a blend of customer relations, project management, and communication skills, which helped establish the candidate’s breadth of knowledge and professional competence.

  I was working on my company's big quarterly project update when two team members left unexpectedly and we were short-handed with three weeks to go. I convened an urgent strategy session where we identified all the projects they were involved in and mapped out our action plan. We shared the most important tasks within the team and got them all done in time. We canceled two optional features that could wait a quarter, and we reached out to a former intern who was able to deliver 15 hours of remote work in the last weekend sprint before the deadline. We were able to complete the project without a delay and delivered on all the essential deliverables by being creative, strategic, and very focused.

  During my time as an analyst for a major airline, I was pulled into a special project where we were asked to look at a potential merger scenario with another carrier. Due to the confidentiality of the project, I was unable to work with peers or use my normal channels for support, and was required to meet a demanding work schedule in order to complete our evaluation in the allotted time. While this project leveraged some of my existing skills, there was still a lot I needed to learn about our acquisition target to complete the work. I made my family aware that I’d need to temporarily shift my evening hours to work. This proactive communication prevented me from facing compounding pressure. I also made sure to communicate daily with my VP. He knew the unique challenge I was facing and could provide guidance, but only if he knew where to help. So I set up daily check-ins with him to show him my progress and receive feedback in a 1:1 setting outside of our normal working group. This added communication helped me avoid any surprises, eased stress, and allowed me to successfully manage and complete an unfamiliar project. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated flexibility by being willing to deviate from a normal workflow.The candidate demonstrated the ability to learn new skills and processes quickly.

  When I was working as a Systems Integration Manager, I was responsible for onboarding a client to our TMS (transportation management solution) on a tight timeline. This was challenging because the client managed their own transportation independently. None of their data or invoicing for freight was centralized, and I was missing a lot of information. We needed to hit our target go-live date because my company had already hired employees for the account and needed the revenue. I knew that I needed to get the info by the end of the week to ensure that I could validate assumptions used for RFP, margin, resource leveling, and so on. I set up a call with the client and they explained that they were short on manpower and would need more time. I offered to visit the sites, conduct the interviews, complete the site and freight profiles, and take all necessary photos. Once I gathered the information, my team keyed in the data and we hit our go-live date without a moment to spare. The project was a success. We hit our revenue numbers as planned, no money was lost, and all parties were very pleased. Thanks to the extra effort, our relationship with that client is stronger than ever. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed leadership by going the extra mile to accomplish a goal for both the company and the client.Success was framed in a way that captured both the short-term impact to the project (meeting sales goals) and the long-term benefit to company growth (strengthening a business relationship).

  I led a rapid, three month-long company-wide initiative to help customers reduce their carbon footprint. To accomplish this goal within an aggressive timeline, I led a team of five subject matter experts to design a new service offering targeting the manufacturing, mining, chemical, and electronics industries. We assessed their current carbon and environmental waste output, and identified areas and opportunities for reduction in a phased approach. We conducted interviews and focus groups with customers, academics, and government officials who had vested interest in sustainability. We then synthesized the findings from the interviews by identifying user profiles and personas across each customer segment, as well as any gaps in key segment profiles and service offering competencies. Finally, we kicked off work around third-party partnerships to assess skills and competencies that complement each other, taking cultural alignment and vision into account. Once the service offering was designed, we conducted a pilot program and defined the SKUs, pricing structure, and legal contracts in collaboration with internal stakeholders. It was a high pressure project, due to the scale of the effort and aggressiveness of the timeline, but results were impressive — generating $10M in attach run rate annually. Why this answer worked well:The example showed the candidate’s expertise and ability to lead complex initiatives.The candidate’s contribution was directly tied to a significant increase in annual revenue.

  When I started in my role, I thought I was quite good at Excel. I had told my employer that I knew how to calculate complex formulas, but I quickly discovered that my experience was well behind that of my peers. I didn’t want my boss to know that I was trailing in my capabilities just as I stepped into the new role, so I came up with a plan to teach myself everything I was missing. Every day after work, I watched at least an hour of Khan Academy videos. I also found practice worksheets online that allowed me to test myself and be sure I was mastering the content.

  In my role as a new manager, I was given a new tele-acquisition channel to manage with little guidance. The channel was brand new to me and my team leader, so we had to get up to speed quickly. I had to learn the channel’s end-to-end process, how it functions, and its various nuances to prevent any negative impact to the business during the ramp up process. I set up time with our internal and external partners to get an understanding of their scope and expectations, and started to build relationships. I took the time to review previous years’ results and understand team pain points. Then, I coalesced all this information and created a process map to clearly lay out our goals and action steps required to smoothly transition — as well as establish myself as the point of contact and project owner for accountability purposes. Due to these efforts, we were able to not only maintain the high standards the channel was running at before we took over, but we also made key process improvements resulting in higher client satisfaction. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to quickly assess situations, solve problems, and activate individuals across different disciplines with little direction.Creating a process that held the team accountable for success showed leadership skills.

  Due to change in senior leadership, we had to aggressively rethink our approach on the next evolution of cloud technology. I led a company-wide effort to define and execute a strategy to move towards a subscription-based cloud solution. First, I worked with my team to define our areas of focus, starting from understanding how our products should work in the future based on the needs, behaviors, desires, and emotions of the customers. We then examined our capabilities as well as current gaps within supply chain, engineering, design, marketing, and sales. We looked at how customers interact with our products. We also obtained third party market research to identify opportunities. From there, I developed a strategy map to lay out ways in which the organization needed to evolve to succeed, and built both business and product roadmaps based on this strategy. Within 8 months, we were able to get full alignment within the team and executed the strategy. We were able to migrate the original solutions to on-prem, hybrid, and private clouds and rolled out offerings to over 100 countries. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated a comfort level with high visibility, high stakes projects.The example showed the candidate’s ability to strategize and execute a plan within an aggressive timeline.

  As a supply chain executive, I’ve always wanted to do an assignment abroad, especially in Mexico where the manufacturing scene is exploding with the creation of new factories driven by government tax credits. My current company has a policy that basic fluency in Spanish is required to be eligible for those roles, so I needed to learn enough to conduct foundational communication with vendor partners. Since my busy schedule didn’t allow for formal language lessons from a private tutor, I enrolled in an online course. I committed to a daily routine at 4:30am while my wife and child were still sleeping so my goal didn’t cut into family time. I also downloaded Duolingo so I could use my commute to practice. Finally, I asked my Spanish-speaking friends to communicate with me only in spanish to help refine my conversational skills. Within 4 months, I was fluent enough to land my dream job as a factory leader in Mexico City on an 18 month expat assignment. Why this answer worked well:The answer highlights the candidate’s ambition and enthusiasm for the role.The candidate demonstrated self-discipline and time management skills.
